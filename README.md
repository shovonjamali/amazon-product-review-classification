# Amazon Product Review Classification
- Performed EDA to understand the data, feature selection, and finding insights
- Pre-processed 500k samples using NLTK
- Used both shallow learning (Decision tree, Random Forrest, and Gradient Boosting) and Deep learning (Simple RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU) models along with GloVe embedding
- Compared the models based on different classification reports such as precision, recall, f1-score, support, and confusion matrix
- Visualized training and validation accuracy and loss to understand overfitting
